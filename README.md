I want to get rid of
This feeling in my chest
This feeling somewhere in my stomach

Three in the morning
I can’t think of anything else
Everything’s fitting like a puzzle
Only a few pieces missing
My my my mind tells me
I’ll have to cross boundaries
I’ll have to, sorry (sorry)
I’ll have to
This feeling has to go (yeah)
I’m a bit scared
The feeling of impending pain
I’m waiting for the rain 
I feel my heart is beating 
I feel my heart is breaking 
I feel it 
I feel it
I feel it 

**Prechorus:**
Trust your gut (gut)
Trust your gut (gut)
Oh my god, You did it, i knew it
Trust your gut (gut)

Trust your gut

LYRICS:
**Intro:**  
In the vastness of the cosmos, where stars dance to the rhythm of unseen forces, the law of entropy quietly creeps into everything (everything)
**Verse 1:**  
I don’t feel you anymore (ohhh)
All I feel is your body (where are you?)  
I look at you, I don’t understand  
Was it just an illusion, u fucking butterfly? (Fly) 
Here and there, here and there
tell me, what the fuck were u lookin’ for? 
I can’t forgive myself (nooo)
I won’t forgive you (noooo)
I’m sick of hearing excuses  
You’re already caught
Stop it (stop it)
Why won’t you just (just)
look me in the eyes? (Eyes)

**Pre-Chorus:**  
I know you still care (i know)
Then what the fuck are u waiting for?  
You’re running out of time (time)
Sort through this shit (ahh)
Find the truth, you bitch 

**Chorus:**  
It will never be 
the same again (u and I)
We are in a state of 
Entropy (ahhhhhhhhh)
Entropy 
Entropy 
I hate the way
It Changes 
Changes everything (everything)
Entropy (ahhhhhhhhh)
A burning car in the ocean 
Entropy (ahhhhhhhhh)
It hurts so fucking much (fucking much)
Entropy (ahhhhhhhhh)
Everything’s fucking 
falling apart, 
Help me, help me out (eh-eh-)
Entropy
eh-eh-eh-entropyyyyyyyyyy

**Verse 2:**  
Too many burns and scars
I’ve got experience, I’m wise  
I’m freezing up, I’m ice now  
Melt me with your lies  
I’ll believe them, it’ll be easier  
I don’t know what you want from me  
Why won’t you just let me go?  
It’s not fair, ‘cause I’m vulnerable   
can’t control it  
Kiss me, tell me you love me  
Tell me he doesn’t matter

**Pre-Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
**Break:** [070 Shake & Toto]
I am a burning car in the ocean (we are)
I am a burning car in the ocean (we are)
I am a burning car in the ocean (I am)
I need my idealized you (you)
Let’s just try to forget 
Just pretend for a little while
I won’t ask for answers
Help me get out of this state
I just need to get out of this state
En- en- en-
En- entro- en- en- en- 
En- en- en- eh- eh- en-en-
eh-eh-eh-entropyyyyyyyyyy ahhhhhhh

My feelings are stronger than this
than me (me)
than my pride (pride)
than my ego (ego)
I’m ready to swallow your lies
Wash them down with alcohol
I’m ready to forgive 
every fucking thing
Just stay here now (stay)
While I recover
From these illusions (illusions)
While I re-re-recover 
Keep your knife gently 
in my heart
It makes it easier for me 
Touch me, hold my hand 
Love me, lie to me again 

Pre-Chorus:
Maybe it’s all a game
Maybe It’s me playing 
the fool 
in this drama 
or maybe it’s Youuuuuuuuu
Yeah, baby, 
I need this so bad
I choose to stay here 
’Cause I’m still addicted 
to this poison (your love)
and I love our 
co-dependent
illusion

Chorus:
I admit it, baby (i admit it)
This is my surrender (ah-I surrender)
I’m emotionally unstable, I’ve fallen 
I surrender (ah-I surrender)
My heart needs it, 
like your love is the only cure
I surrender (ah-I surrender)
’Cause I need you now 
and it’s BAD BAD BAD BAD 
for both of us (both of us)
I surrender (ah-I surrender)
ah-I surrender
Ah-i  (3x)
Ah-I admit it (3x) 
I Surrender (ah-ah-) 

Verse 2:
I’m so damn turned on, 
and that’s my problem
Red lips, smoke, and alcohol
I’m trying to see the real you, 
but I can’t 
Y-y-y-you seem like
someone else
You know we’ll still 
spend this night together, 
like yesterday
I I I I don’t understand 
why it’s all like this  
I should be running 
and never looking back  
But I’m not even trying  
I’m not even trying 

Pre-Chorus:
Chorus:
Bridge:
I don’t wanna love u
U fucked up big time
Your eyes are full of tears

There’s something wrong 
with us, it’s fucking obvious
And you fucking know it,
I’m not a good guy 
Chorus:

04 The Knight [genres: alternative R&B, R&B, dark R&B]
LYRICS:
**Verse 1:**  
The sky is as gray 
as if the universe knows 
exactly how I feel inside
Look, black ravens flying down  
Here comes the rain, so cinematic  
Raindrops on metal, but I won’t rust  
And there you are, 
back in my thoughts, 
fucking everything up again  
I’m so tired of your shit, 
just leave me alone  
Can’t you see I’ve changed? 
I’m not the same anymore 
Look at me 

Pre-chorus:
Ohhh maybe you’re scared to 
see your reflection 
in the sword stuck in my heart?
I’ve been through this 
Fucking 
Draining  
Emotional 
Hell (ohh)

I met that woman (Alex)
She said, "This is the Seven of Swords"  
Then she showed the "Ten"  
(You’re a knight, you’re a knight)  
"It’s all about you and her, 
that’s true, 
they’re all yours"  
I took them, so…

**Chorus:**  
Now that I’ve got 
my sword and shield  
I feel like a knight  
I’ve got my sword and shield  
I feel like a knight 
No one’s gonna hurt me anymore  
‘got my sword and shield  
I feel like a knight (feel like)
I might be a bad guy here, but 
I feel like a knight (feel like a knight)
I’m stronger now 
I feel like a knight  (feel like)
I feel like a knight 
Feel Like a n-n-n-knight

**Verse 2:**  
I remember when you 
drunkenly talked about regrets 
(such a fucking bitch)  
I fucking know everything 
about you, baby  
You’re not even an open book, 
you’re a tabloid, 
a trashy romance (dime novel)
Just like that prince of yours, 
without a horse and taste  
I knew it all, now it’s just digital ruins, 
does that make you sad?  
You seem so superficial now 
Maybe I’m the worst 
person on the planet 
for saying this  
But you know why it’s like this

**Pre-chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  

**Bridge:**  
I no longer feel pain,
It’s still a bit tough,
But I’ll get through it,
You know that (you know)
I’ve fucking won, (feel like a knight)
And this isn’t even a game
I’m stepping into the light and shining,
I’m at peace with my skeletons,
While you’re stuck with them (you’re stuck).
I’ve been through this 
Fucking 
Draining  
Emotional 
Hell (hell)

*Chorus*

09 Mommy-Daddy Issues [genres: indie pop, shoegaze + R&B]
LYRICS:
**Verse 1:**  
I don’t know how to help each other  
I thought we were so alike  
We used to have a million things to talk about  
Now it's just alcohol and old stories  
I could try to fix some things, 
it feels one-sided  
Too bad we always fuck things up 
when we’re in a shitty mood  

**Pre-chorus:**  
I know, babe, you’ve got your daddy issues  
The thing is, I’ve got mine too  
Not just daddy issues, but also mommy ones  
Yeah, baby, I’ve got both
Maybe we should see a therapist?  

**Chorus:**  
While it’s still not too late  
We need to figure out, babe  
How to save this, if it’s worth it  
Kiss me, love me  (mommy issues)
Yell at me, respect me  (daddy issues)
When I’m cold, try to be warm (mommy issues)
When you feel small, 
I’ll try to be strong (daddy issues)
daddy issues 
Mommy issues 
daddy issues 
Mommy issues 

**Verse 2:**  
I need your love and care  
But it’s never quite enough,
sometimes it’s too much  
Sometimes it’s not what I need  
I can’t give you what I don’t have  
You need my love and care  
But it’s never quite enough, 
not what you want  
We’re not yin and yang, 
we’re not balanced  
We’re so out of sync, 
but why the fuck are we 
so drawn to each other?  

**Pre-chorus:**  

**Chorus:**  

**Break:** 
Don’t try to control me
Control me
You kissed someone else
I hate you
Hold me
I love you
I don’t want to be with you
You’re not enough
You’re not what I need
Please, just love me
Why are you searching in me
things I don’t have?
Emotional mess
daddy daddy issues
mommy mommy issues
daddy daddy issues
mommy mommy issues

**Bridge:**  
Tell me how to love you  
I’ll try
Hope it’s not too late  
Honestly I Don’t care if it is

11 Just Give Me A Little Time [indie rock, post-rock, britpop]

Verse 1:
Sometimes I still fall back into that loop
That spiral of 
tearing myself apart
I hate it when I can’t control it
Hate it when it keeps me up
Spinning so hard it makes my head dizzy
Spinning so hard it makes my head dizzy
Spinning so hard it makes my head dizzy
(dizzy dizzy dizzy)

what we used to be… 
what we could 
What we could 
be 

Chorus:
Just give me a little time (a little time)
I’m trying to figure myself out
But if I can’t, 
I’ll need you to help me
I’ll try to pull myself out alone
Just give me a little time
Stay with me… (just in case)
Just give me a little time
Just give me a little time
Just give me a little
Time 

Verse 2:
My head feels so heavy (heavy)
Sometimes I think I got too weak for this
I used to handle all the tricks 
my brain would play
Juggling the chaos
Playing along, watch myself break 
Didn’t even flinch 
But now… I think I need a little light
Something soft, 
something simple

Pre-Chorus:

Chorus:

Bridge:
It’s too much pressure
I need to breathe
need to calm down
need to breathe 
need to calm down
need to breathe 
need to calm down

Chorus (final):
Just give me a little time (a little time time time)
I’m trying to figure myself out (figure myself out)
But if I can’t, (if I)
I’ll need you to help me (help me)

Stay with me… (just in case)

Just give me a little
Time (time time time)

[DELUXE EDITION]
14 Different Future [art rock, avant-garde, neo-psychedelia, dream pop, electronic pop, synthpop]
LYRICS:
Verse 1:
My escapism is futurism
I’m always waiting for new technology 
I’m addicted, guess it’s my passion
Give me the new (something n-n neuro-new) 
Let me get inside my head (Mah-mah-Musk)
Delete the things that cause me pain
Cuz I’m trying to be better, i know it’s so pointless 
Our world tries to be better
But we lose every fucking time (every fucking time)

Pre-chorus:
I hate this job,
I wanna inspire, be an influencer (like, subscribe)
I need that subscription, I’ll become their muse
Need to upgrade my device (I’ve got nothing to eat).
Third-world country (bad luck).
I’ll make it all happen in another (future)
Let me in, let me into your club 

Chorus:
Feels like
We’re living in
Some different (different) future
This isn’t what 
the astrologers 
futurists promised
Maybe we should listen to 
what scientists, 
sociologists say? 
Feels like
This is a different (different) future
(Not so bright)
Feels like
This is a different (different) future
(Not so happy)
Feels like
This is a different (different) future
We’re striving to be better, 
but for (what?) ?
Different (3x)
Future (3x)

Verse 2:
We’re often chasing
Other people’s dreams, 
you know it? They sold us t-t-techno-happiness and comfort
But techno-comfort isn’t that comfy
If you really think about it
Are you happy? Are you fucking happy?
I’m searching for true freedom
In a place and time where

Not everything is real 
Not everything is as it seems (x2)
Not everything is real 
Not everything is as it seems (x2)

The world has gone mad (really)
We should be scared (should we?)
But we’re just so calm (why?)

Pre-chorus:

Chorus:

Break:
made my dream come true
‘cause im chilling here, watching the ocean waves
four new fucking notifications 
Do Not Disturb mode should be my
new rule
Damn, seems like
another war 
just started somewhere (another war just started somewhere)

Chorus: 

Outro:
D-d-d-d-Different (3x)
F-f-Future (3x)

15 I Just Need To Stop Overthinking [alt R&B]
LYRICS:
Verse 1:
It's been inside me for so so long  
Honestly, I'm surprised I'm still alive  
Still love to laugh  
Pills? don’t think so 
So many contradictions  
So much confusion  
So much self-hate  
So much pain, oh God  
I just want to stop  
Thinking so much  
Become light  
and fly in the sky like a bird  

Pre-Chorus: 
Running from myself  
Running from you  
Running from everyone  
My subconscious mind 
Is my enemy  

Chorus: 
I just need  
To stop over-overthinking  
I can’t handle my thoughts  
I’m losing to my mind  
I just need  
To stop over-overthinking  
I want to be happy 
and simple  
I just need  
To stop over-overthinking  
Doctor, can you prescribe  
Something for this?  
I just need  
To stop overthinking  

Verse 2:  
When I feel bad,  
I hide in  
The safe  
Corners  
Of my  
Mind  
Sometimes I get lost there  
End up in places  
That every time  
Leave me broken  
I’m so tired of constantly  
Running from myself  
From my thoughts  
I wish I could  
Delete some things in my head  
Without the option  
To restore it  

Pre-chorus: 

Chorus:


Break:
I’m so tired of myself  
I’m so exhausting  
Alcohol won’t help, they said  
So why am I just 
dancing and smiling?  
why am I just 
dancing and smiling?  

**<Chorus>**

Whose god is watching through it?
So many archetypes (ah-)

Verse 2
You know I won’t save you
I’ll soundtrack your your downfall, your failed era
They're fanatics, we're all heretics

Dance, dance while they judge us
We're super weird, but we’re the real ones

I sacrificed all this
so you could dance
feeling the pain
from the scattered
shards of my music dreams

Broadcasting-
Super weird thoughts
Now in your head-
Projecting-
Super weird visuals
Transmitting-
Super weird sounds

I- I- did something for this

We became one 
pulsing shape of light
We spin weightless,

A guitar riff is our vessel
carrying us through colors

Through a time (tiiiiime)
that doesn’t tick right

Ohh 
we spin weightless
We spin-
We spin-
Spin weightless 
we spin weightless
We spin-
We spin-
Spin weightless 
we spin weightless
We spin-
We spin-
Spin weightless 


Oh no,
I didn’t call you here
I never meant to bring you here

Why does it feel like you’re close?
Like you’re right here with me?
Like you’re seeing what I see?
Are you seeing what I see?
Are you seeing what I see?
Are you seeing what I—

can’t say a word —
Only music has control now
And I feel like I’m naked
But I speak… and you answer
without saying a thing 
(without saying a thing)
Some telepathic, 
strange thing 

Ohh 
we spin weightless
We spin-
We spin-
Spin weightless 
we spin weightless
We spin-
We spin-
Spin weightless 
we spin weightless
We spin-
We spin-
Spin weightless

"DRIVING FAST" [genres: experimental electronic, alt pop, psychedelic pop]
LYRICS:
Verse 1:
I saw something
weird as hell 
back then,
I forgot it all, 
just fragments 
just pic-ah 
pic-ah pictures
burned in acid colors
in my fucking brain
I was racing to escape 
that fucking nightmare’s grip,
But every time it sucked me 
deeper deeper
into the trip’s diamond’s prisms
Heart racing like a drum 
LIKE A DRUM
LIKE A DRUM 
No way to stop it 
No way to stop it
No way to stop it 
Stop it 

I saw something weird 
(super fucking weird)
Scared I’d lose my hold on what’s real,
scared to lose
to lose myself 

Chorus: 
Now I’m afraid of 
driving fast,
Fast, (fast)-Fast, (fast)-Fast. (Fast)
Slow it down, slow it down, 
(I’m begging you)
Now I’m afraid of 
driving fast,
Fast, (fast) - Fast, (fast) - Fast. (Fast)
Now I’m afraid of 
driving fast
I’m afraid of
afraid of 
a-a-a-afraid of
D-d-d-driving fast

Verse 2:
Minutes felt like seconds, 
time bent and broke
a fucked-up loop
I didn’t think I 
could climb out of
My brain was gone (GONE)
My body briefly served 
as an anchor (ANCHOR)
Between hundreds 
of TWISTED visions  
Visions 
Visions 
Visions 
I 
I saw something weird 
(super fucking weird)
Scared I’d lose my hold on what’s real,
scared to lose
to lose myself

Those

Out of the deep dark night
Gonna read all these personas, keen 
Without a word,

Going straight through to their soul
Waking something special up in them

Oh-oh, oh oh 
Except (for) you, baby, 
you stole the whole fucking show

these fragrant echo- 
echoes of days 
gone by
real quiet (real quiet)
Gonna stay out here
a little longer with the roses,
drifting through a technicolor 
flow of zinnias 
until the stars, until the stars

They know I come here
for some peace
for the hush between my thoughts
Waiting on the rain,

They get me like no one else does
And with the warm wind, 
they breathe out 
these fragrant echo-

Late Night Talk (Show) [synthpop, indie pop, dream pop,ambient R&B]
Verse 1:
You were gone so long
Feels like a century slipped by me
Your voice was distant
Like I was talking to someone else 
Wrapped in your skin but not your soul
Now it’s so bright, it’s really you
Alive and chasing thrills again

So tell me, how do you feel?
What’s your heart saying 
You know I’m always on your side
Though I know trusting you 
is just a lost cause

But if you ever wanna talk, (talk talk)
If you feel like you’ve been missing this…
We could crack one open,
And have our late-night talk (show)

Oh, baby

it’s time to close that fucking chapter
You know damn well
I only want the best for you
You know how tough it is to get
That fucking inner peace,
With all of this, with all of this 
It’s all shifting in my mind
I’m seeing things through 
new eyes now


So tell me, how do you feel?
What’s your heart saying 
You know I’m always on your side
Though I know trusting you 
is just a lost cause


Bridge:
You see, some things have changed
Some things just don’t hit the same

And I’m okay with that

But that was you
Yeah baby, it was you

Verse 2: 
Oh, baby 
you’ve said that before
it’s time to close that fucking chapter
You know damn well
I only want the best for you
You know how tough it is to get
That fucking inner peace,
With all of this, with all of this 
It’s all shifting in my mind
I’m seeing things through 
new eyes now


So tell me, how do you feel?
What’s your heart saying 
You know I’m always on your side
Though I know trusting you 
is just a lost cause


Bridge:
You see, some things have changed
Some things just don’t hit the same
Joy’s a little quieter now
After the storms you brought inside
And I’m okay with that 
Baby, im okay with that
I don’t want to look back
But that was you
Yeah baby, it was you

Chorus: 


//Album: The Shining Club (2023): [Synthpop, EDM, Pop, R&B]//

The Shining Club [genres: synthpop, pop-disco, pop]
LYRICS:
Tah-tarah-tarah-tap (3x)

[Verse 1]
We’re in the hottest
spot in town 
Or we just land
inside your fantasy?
Left the fear in history
No dress code
No password
Just promise:
You’ll show up as you
The glow wraps around
figures, 
shapes, 
silhouettes
You are a living artwork,
You are a moment
You don’t beg for space —
You become the room (without walls)

[Pre-chorus]
You are the anthem
They said tone it down
You said volume up
You know you’ve got it
So let it 
Let it 
Let it shine! 

[Chorus]
You’re dancing 
In the shining club (ohh)
Shine (dont stop, dont stop)
We own the dark, 
we own the light
Shine 
All night long, all night long
Shine 
Oh-oh
In the Shining Club
You’re already a star
Light the night (light the night)
Cause’ Now you know how to
Shine 
Shine 
Shine 

[Verse 2]
Who’s that beauty in headphones?
Heels like daggers
Eyes like sirens
Dont talk to me couture 
Look What a guy! 
What a ma-cho ma-cho
Silver jacket, tailored tight 
Why he lookin’ sad?
We’re loving that ‘stache 

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Break]
You don’t-
You don’t need- ah
You don’t need permission to shine (shine)
You made-
You made it- ah
You made it through the shine portal
Welcome to The Shining Club
Click-clack like it’s Studio 54
inside your mind
No gods here, only stars
You’re the one, yeah, 
you’re the one
Used to shrink
Now you shi-shimmer
Left, right
Freak, light
You didn’t even need to speak
Cause the light translated you
The light translated you

[Chorus]

Blue Tonight [genres: synthpop, electro]

Verse 1: 
Ohhh blue blue blue 
Day by day, 
it feels like I’ve been on 
some emotional diet, 
It’s dragged on too long
Guess I’m done with self-control
Feel like letting halo slip
Cravin’ something 
they gonna judge,
I’m their energy vampire, 
feeding off their judgment
I feel on top 
when they’re mad (feel on top)

Pre-chorus: 
Hello? 
Thought we could drive 
nowhere
just to escape this gloom
‘Cause I don’t-

Chorus: 
Oh I don’t wanna be blue tonight (blue)
Just wanna feel the wind on my skin
As we speed through the midnight, 
Destination unknown (destination unknown)

I don’t wanna be blue tonight (blue)
Sick of the same old, same old 
Need something real, 
something new 
something heart-racing (heart-racing)

I don’t wanna be blue tonight (blue tonight)
Let’s break the loop, let it all go (let it all go) 
‘Cause I don’t wanna be-
I don’t wanna be-
Blue- 
I don’t wanna be blue tonight (tonight)

Verse 2: 
Nothing like being part 
of these city lights
Not that I’m trying 
to find the ghost 
of who I used to be 
I just hate the way 
I’ve been feelin’ lately 

but then that song came on 
while i was stuck at the red light  
watching a smoky-eyed blonde
angel balancing on broken 
eight-inch heel 
near the sinners’ 
neon temple
and it just hit me 
like gospel:  
it’s  
time to live again,  
time to shine again

Pre-chorus: 


Chorus: 

Break: 
I- i- i- I know what can help us 
I-i-I don’t care if it’s 
inappropriate (tonight)

Slap 
slap 
slap 
Parental Advisory Label us (label us)
All over our skin (all over our skin)

Metaphorically speaking 
We better hit that 
hit that
factory reset button 

And I 
I 
I 
scream freedom in your face 


B-b-blue 
to-to-tonight
Blue 
Blue 
Blue 
Chorus:

LOVE IS WHEN Ü [genres: dance pop, electro pop, French house, French touch, indie pop]
LYRICS:
Verse 1:
Oh oh oh 
It’s magic, baby (oh)
we’re still electric like this
Time melts away, but we stay crystalline
Thought we'd settle down, 
maybe play it cool (cool)
But we're still glowing, baby
We’re still shining 

Oh, we’ve wandered
through the years in sync 
can’t believe we’re still this radiant, 
this wild, this bold (oh)
I recall that starry night 
when our eyes first met 
it was cosmic, baby (oh)
It was scripted by the universe, 
We were so young and loud, 
And when I’m drifting 
in that timeless melody  
I picture us, (I picture us)
carried through the years (ohh)

Pre-chorus:
Don’t even ask me if I love you
‘Cause you know the answer
You said, “so tell me —
what is love?
and I said 

Chorus:
Love is when 
you… 
Love is when 
you… 
Love is when 
you… 
Oh oh Love is when you… 
Love is when you (Love is)
Love is when you 

Bridge:
look at me that way
When your embrace feels like home 
and I feel complete, alive.
When we laugh and 
the whole street
feels high (high) on love 
When you’re 
just here 
with me (oooh)

Verse 2:
Oh, we’re stargazers in sunglasses
We’re extra dreamers floating in the current
Some think we’re superfreaks, 
some say we’re lost
Some just don’t get us (ugh)
Who cares, our hearts stay open
We live it, oh we live it, We vibinʼ
Every moment 
Oh this wild and endless ride 

Pre-chorus:

Chorus:

Bridge:


Break:
Reviviendo esos recuerdos,
que en mi pecho se quedaron.
Las fotos viejas me miran,
como si el tiempo no pasara.
Siempre supe que fue real.
Así que bésame, bebé.
Así que bésame, bebé.

Chorus:
Love is when 
you… 

Ooooooo, la la la la la la la la la la love
Love love love Love love love Love love love 
Ooooooo, that’s love
Ooooooo, that’s true love
Love is when u
